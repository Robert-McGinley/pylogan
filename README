PyLogAn Readme

This tool is a Log Analyzer. It is inspired by the modlogan idea of input,
process and output isolation.

It was created because of the need of a log analyzer for squid that use the
syslog lines. The only option the author find was modlogan but it is
discontinuated. The goal was to get a good code, capable of been developed and to solve the needs of the author.

The author have almost no time to spend on it but belives that it worth the
effort, there are a lot of posibilities and maybe is good to write it here.

Here it goes...

Present ToDo:
-Format the table for a better reading
-Extend the inline doc (__doc__)
-Fix the setup.py to work with python 3

Big ToDo:
-Add lxml and do a lot more of getElementByID
-Remove the abuse of dictionaries in favour of tuples and lists, there are a lot
of interfaces in output that works better with lists of tuples (to get a sort,
for example)
-The whole cosmetic job, work with the CSS to make it look pretty
-Attach the code text strings to some kind of internationalization (like i18n
maybe, don't know)
-Review all the text and correct the author's poor english ;-)

Future ToDo:
-Make more reports (more processing)
-Support of detailed reports (with hyperlinks)
-Implementation of other inputs and outputs (SQL,XML,SOAP,plane text,etc.)
