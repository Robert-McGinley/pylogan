This is pylogan version 0.3.2

This script is a Log Analyzer. It is inspired by the modlogan idea of input,
process and output isolation.

It was created because of the need of a log analyzer for squid that use the
syslog lines. The only option the author find was modlogan but it is
discontinuated. The goal was to get a good code, capable of been developed and to solve the needs of the author.

The author have almost no time to spend on it but belives that it worth the
effort, there are a lot of posibilities and maybe is good to write it here.

Version 1.0.0 ToDo:
- Add lxml and do a lot more of getElementByID or XPath OR use XQuery with ... (lxml?)
- Remove the abuse of dictionaries in favour of tuples and lists.
- The whole cosmetic job, work with the CSS to make it look pretty, format the tables for a better reading (CSS)
- Use some kind of internationalization.
- Review all the text and correct the author's poor english ;-)

Future ToDo:
- Make more reports (more processing)
- Support of detailed reports (with hyperlinks)
- Implementation of other inputs and outputs (SQL, XML, SOAP, plane text, etc.)
